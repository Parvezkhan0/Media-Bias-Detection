# Description: This program performs sentiment analysis on news articles using TextBlob.

# Method Purpose: Given a news summary, extracts polarity and subjectivity metrics, returning both in a readable format.

# -------------------------------------------------------------

# Method Purpose: Given a list with numeric values, calculates and returns the average of all.

# Method Purpose: Given an average polarity or subjectivity, uses intervals to calculate accurate sentiments.
# Note: Polarity and Subjectivity in TextBlob fall in between -1 and 1, this method bases its intervals off of that.
