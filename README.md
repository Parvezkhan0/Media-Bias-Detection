# Newspaper-Scrape
By Rohak Jain

The official GitHub repository for the Newspaper Scrape Project, which uses advanced natural language processing techniques, sentiment analysis, and web scraping to extract summaries, metadata, and levels of polarity and subjectivity from articles on the New York Times' technology section.

Throughout my code, I have placed detailed comments explaining what each method does, its function, and some explanations on complex lines of code. Additionally, if you want to clone or use this repository for yourself, feel free to use GitHub Desktop or PyCharm to copy my code and tweak it to your liking! Once again, if you have any questions, feel free to post them in the "Issues" section of the repo and I will try my best to get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for viewing my project, I hope this helped you out!
